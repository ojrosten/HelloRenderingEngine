# HelloRenderingEngine

HelloRenderingEngine is a teaching project. It aims to explore modern techniques in C++ through building
an OpenGL rendering engine. It is inspired by Joey de Vries excellent site 
[Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Hello-Triangle) but with some major differences.
In particular, the point is to build a robust framework, in which functionality is composable.

So it's a combination of cutting-edge C++ and OpenGL. If you like the Dr Who episode featuring
androids with mechanical brains, this project may appeal to you!
